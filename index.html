                <h3>🔒 Your Privacy in a Nutshell</h3>
                <p><strong>We do NOT collect, transmit, or store ANY of your data.</strong></p>
                <p>All your tree planting records, crew information, and reports stay entirely on your device. No servers, no cloud storage, no tracking, no analytics.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Numbies ("we", "our", or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data in our tree planting operations management application.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Data Collection - What We DON'T Collect</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>We do not collect any personal information or usage data.</strong> Specifically, we do not collect:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal identification information (names, email addresses, phone numbers)</li>
                <li>Device information or unique identifiers</li>
                <li>Location data or GPS coordinates</li>
                <li>Usage statistics or analytics</li>
                <li>Crash reports or error logs</li>
                <li>Any data about how you use the App</li>
                <li>Any information about crew members you enter into the App</li>
                <li>Any tree planting data, reports, or statistics</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
            <p>
                All data you create in the App is stored locally on your device using React Native AsyncStorage. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Crew member names and statistics</li>
                <li>Block information and seedlot configurations</li>
                <li>Daily planting reports and tree counts</li>
                <li>Box tracking data</li>
                <li>App settings and preferences</li>
                <li>Historical statistics and charts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>This data never leaves your device</strong> unless you explicitly export it using the backup functionality.
            </p>

            <h2>4. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
            <p>
                Your data is used solely for the App's functionality on your device:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracking daily tree planting activities</li>
                <li>Calculating crew member earnings and statistics</li>
                <li>Generating PDF and Excel reports</li>
                <li>Creating charts and visualizations</li>
                <li>Managing block and seedlot information</li>
                <li>Tracking box usage for overclaim analysis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Since all processing happens locally on your device, your data is never transmitted to external servers or third parties.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>We do not share your data with anyone.</strong> There are no third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or data processors involved. The App operates completely offline and does not require an internet connection (except for optional features like accessing the feedback form or these legal pages).
            </p>

            <h2>6. Data Export and Backup</h2>
            <p>
                The App provides a backup feature that allows you to export your data to a JSON file stored in your device's Downloads folder. This backup file:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is created only when you explicitly choose to back up your data</li>
                <li>Remains on your device unless you manually share or transfer it</li>
                <li>Is not automatically uploaded to any cloud service</li>
                <li>Can be used to restore your data if you reinstall the App</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you choose to share backup files via email, cloud storage, or other means, you are responsible for the security and privacy of that data.
            </p>

            <h2>7. PDF and Excel Reports</h2>
            <p>
                When you generate PDF or Excel reports, these files are created locally on your device. If you choose to share these reports using the built-in share functionality, they are sent through your device's standard sharing mechanism. We do not have access to or control over how you share these reports.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Internet Permissions</h2>
            <p>
                The App may request internet access for the following optional features only:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Opening the feedback form in your web browser</li>
                <li>Accessing these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy pages</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                No data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers through these connections.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a secure lock screen on your device</li>
                <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
                <li>Regularly backing up your data</li>
                <li>Being cautious when sharing backup files or reports</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
            <p>
                You have complete control over your data:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delete individual reports:</strong> Deleted reports are moved to a Recycling Bin where they can be restored or permanently deleted</li>
                <li><strong>Archive crew members:</strong> Crew members can be archived to hide them from active lists while preserving historical data</li>
                <li><strong>Delete all data:</strong> The "Delete All Data" option in Settings permanently removes all information from the App</li>
                <li><strong>Uninstall the App:</strong> Uninstalling the App will delete all locally stored data (unless you have created backups in your Downloads folder)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                The App is not specifically directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since we don't collect any data at all, this policy applies universally to all users regardless of age.
            </p>

            <h2>12. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>
                Because all data is stored locally on your device and we do not collect or transmit any information, you automatically have:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full ownership:</strong> You own all data you create in the App</li>
                <li><strong>Complete access:</strong> All your data is always accessible within the App</li>
                <li><strong>Export rights:</strong> You can export your data at any time using the backup feature</li>
                <li><strong>Deletion rights:</strong> You can delete any or all data at any time</li>
                <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Backup files are in JSON format and can be used outside the App</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>13. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                The App does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or social media services. The only external links are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The feedback form (Google Forms) - optional, user-initiated</li>
                <li>These legal documents (GitHub Pages) - optional, user-initiated</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we don't collect your contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes. We recommend reviewing this page periodically.
            </p>

            <h2>15. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>
